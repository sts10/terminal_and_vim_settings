# A Back-up of My Terminal and Text Editor Setup Files

This is a snapshot of my terminal and Vim-related configuration files. 

## To Use

### Bash Profile
Rename `bash_profile` to `.bash_profile` and place it into `~/`. If no `~/.bash_profile` exists in your system yet, you can do this with `curl -o ~/.bash_profile https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sts10/terminal_and_vim_settings/master/bash_profile` or, from inside this cloned repo: `cp bash_profile ~/.bash_profile`. Restart your terminal for changes to take effect.

Note, this `bash_profile` sets `export USR_PATHS="/usr/local:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/bin"` and adds that to the PATH. Thus, you'll want to add things like the Sublime Text command line tool and other CLTs in `/usr/local/bin` to have easy access to them. 

This `bash_profile` is based off [the Flatiron School's recommended bash profile](https://github.com/flatiron-school/dotfiles/blob/master/bash_profile).

### Vim Setup

Consider installing an up-to-date version your preferred type of Vim before starting this section. See section below.

Replace your current vimrc with mine by running:

```shell
curl -o ~/.vimrc https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sts10/terminal_and_vim_settings/master/vimrc
```

If you're running Ubuntu and Neovim v 2.X, I suggest using this vim config file (though you'll need to [install vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#installation) yourself beforehand, as well as curl and git): 

```shell
mkdir ~/.config/nvim
curl -o ~/.config/nvim/init.vim https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sts10/terminal_and_vim_settings/master/linux/init.vim
```

#### Troubleshooting Vim Setup
- If the above `curl` command isn't working for some reason, clone this directory and run `cp vimrc ~/.vimrc` from inside this repo's directory.
- Maybe some directories weren't created correctly. My vimrc setup requires a few. You can manually `mkdir` the directories: `~/.vim`, `~/.vim/backup`, `~/.vim/swap`, `~/.vim/undo`
- If you had trouble installing [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) and/or our plugins, head over to [the vim-plug readme](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#installation) for installation instructions. Afterward remember run `:PlugInstall` in a Vim buffer. 
- If the set `Mustard` colorscheme doesn't automatically load, place `mustard.vim` into `~/.vim/colors/` (which you may have to `mkdir` yourself). Then either run `:colorscheme mustard` and then `set background=dark` or put those two commands into your `.vimrc` (they're already in the `vimrc` file in this repo).

### Flavors of Vim

- Installing **MacVim**: [Download the .dmg file of the latest MacVim snapshot from the macvim-dev fork](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim/releases/) (though it may be better/easier to update MacVim if [installed from the command line via Homebrew](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/59375/how-do-i-install-macvim)). Once installed, you're going to want to setup the command line `mvim` command (should be included in the download) by putting the `mvim` file in place-- you can do this by running `cp mvim /usr/local/bin/` (although it might better to symlink it with `ln` command?). For help, here's [my blog post on making the switch](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2015/08/07/from-terminal-vim-to-mac-vim/).
- Installing **Neovim**: [Instructions for installing NeoVim with Homebrew](https://github.com/neovim/homebrew-neovim/blob/master/README.md) plus [my blog post on NeoVim](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2015/08/11/neovim-an-open-source-project/). Homebrew [lives here](http://brew.sh/). Neovim's ["Following HEAD" page lives here](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Following-HEAD). 
To symlink your normal Vim configuration for Neovim to use, run `ln -s ~/.vim ~/.config/nvim` and `ln -s ~/.vimrc ~/.config/nvim/init.vim` after installation. There's also [an OS X iTerm + Neovim app launcher](https://github.com/flipxfx/neovim-iterm-app).
- Installing the latest version of **(Terminal) Vim**: We're going to use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), but since we prefer vim-plug, here's how we've got to do this. If you already have [RVM](https://rvm.io/) installed, first run `rvm use system`, then run `brew install vim`, then return to your preferred version of Ruby for RVM. You shouldn't need any special alias in your `bash_profile` to use this new version of Vim. Note: `which vim` tells you where your `vim` lives.
- Installing **VimR** (a MacOS GUI for Neovim): Head over to [the VimR releases page](https://github.com/qvacua/vimr/releases) and grab the latest version (you may also want to consult [the MacOS Neovim installation page](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/wiki/Installing-Neovim#macos--os-x)). Once you've installed VimR and moved it into your Applications folder, you can install the command line tool (`vimr`) by launching VimR, going to preferences, copying the command line tool to a directory, and then moving it into your path with a Terminal command like `mv vimrc /usr/local/bin/`. 
- Installing **Neovim dot app**: [neovim dot app](https://github.com/rogual/neovim-dot-app) is an experimental MacOS GUI for Neovim. As of this writing you can install it via Homebrew. The command line tool is `gnvim`. Here is [my blog post about it](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2015/10/24/neovim-dot-app/).

### Coding Font

My go-to coding font is [Deja Vu Sans Mono](http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/Download). If unavailable, [Hack](https://github.com/chrissimpkins/Hack) and [Google's Noto Mono](https://www.google.com/get/noto/#mono-mono) are nice alternatives (and [Noto Sans](https://www.google.com/get/noto/#sans-lgc) size 16 or 18 is a good choice for your chat applications). [More info on my colors/font setup](http://sts10.github.io/blog/2014/02/14/my-current-coding-setup/). 

### Terminal

I'd recommend [iTerm2 v3.0.1+](https://iterm2.com/downloads.html). Some settings to change once installed:

- In `Preferences > Profiles > Terminal`, set Report Terminal Type "xterm-256color"
- In `Preferences > Profiles > Colors`, import `sam_2015_iterm.itermcolors` as a "Color Preset".
- In `Preferences > Profiles > Colors`, check "Smart Cursor Color"
- Then in `Preferences > Profiles > Text`
  - Uncheck "Draw Anti-alias text with thin strokes" or set it to never.
  - Have both fonts be anti-aliased
  - (Optional:) Set Cursor to "Box" and turn on blinking.
- In `Preferences > Advanced`, search for "Terminal windows resize smoothly", and change it to "Yes".
- I'm not sure if you have to set the background and foreground colors manually.

If using OS X's default Terminal application (which I don't recommend given its handling of colors, particularly when using Vim), `sam_terminal_2015.terminal` can be imported as a profile. 

### Sublime Text

I've also included two files related to my [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) setup (though most preferences will carry over to [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)). The two files are my user_preferences and my keybindings. 

My preferred Sublime theme is [Mustard](http://colorsublime.com/theme/Mustard). For spell check and other settings specific to Markdown files, you'll need to write those settings yourself in the appropriate file location. The only major package you might want is ["Expand Selection to Quotes"](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Expand%20Selection%20to%20Quotes).

To symlink Sublime's command line tool, run something like `ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/subl" /usr/local/bin/subl`
